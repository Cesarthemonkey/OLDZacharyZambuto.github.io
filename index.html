              >Hello my name is Zachary Zambuto I am a senior studying Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Connecticut. During my time at UCONN I absolutely fell in love with startups and creating things out of thin air. My experience involves attempting to start my own company during school and helping out other small teams and startups from New York City to San Francisco. As of now I am trying to continue this exciting journey by looking for opportunities to work with other early stage companies!
